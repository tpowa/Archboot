# This file contains some information for
# the passwd (1) command and other tools 
# creating or modifying passwords.

# Define default crypt hash
# CRYPT={des,md5,blowfish}
CRYPT=des

# Use another crypt hash for group passwowrds.
# This is used by gpasswd, fallback is the CRYPT entry.
# GROUP_CRYPT=des


# We can override the default for a special service
# by appending the service name (FILES, YP, NISPLUS, LDAP)

# for local files, use a more secure hash. We
# don't need to be portable here:
CRYPT_FILES=blowfish
# sometimes we need to specify special options for
# a hash (variable is prepended by the name of the
# crypt hash).
BLOWFISH_CRYPT_FILES=5

# For NIS, we should always use DES:
CRYPT_YP=des
